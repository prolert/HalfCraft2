// co-op hosting: the console commands client.dll's hc_host runs to host co-op for two. a two-slot listen server
// on a map, with coop 0: coop 1 breaks every map change after it (the engine then starts no new map), and with two
// slots the engine sets deathmatch 1 itself, which is what makes a dead player respawn instead of the map reload.
// sv_lan 1 keeps the server to the lan; a vpn (radmin, hamachi) needs sv_lan 0. pure: no windows, no sdk.
